SNAT, for NATing from the private addresses to the Public (ProviderAddressOfTheRouterInterface)
1) Enabling SNAT, and the interface of the router took the ProviderIpAddress, any Machine on LAN should ping to internet, NSG Allows by default EGREES
2) we use floating IPs only for external access, then One2One NAT is done.
3) Chaib: Why not the switchProviderNetwork = Public Ip addresses $$$$
4) "Provider on 203.0.113.0/24 with gateway 203.0.113.1"
   This network requires a gateway to provide Internet access to instances in your OpenStack environment.
5) The provider interface uses a special configuration without an IP address assigned to it. Configure the second interface as the provider interface:


Solutions:
1) I have solved this problem by redesigning my provider network. The neutron_external_network interface should be bonded to the interface which can have an Internet access. Thank you all again !
2) if no free ip address available for kolla_internal_vip_address, please set enable_haproxy to "no"
ifnot:
	kolla_internal_vip_address: "10.10.10.254" should be an unused Ip address
	network_interface: "eth0"
	kolla_external_vip_address: "10.10.20.254"
	kolla_external_vip_interface: "eth1"
